# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```


## Impermanent Loss
Impermanent loss for liquidity providers is the change in dollar terms of their total stake in a given pool versus just holding the assets.

suppose WETH price = $3000
suppose DAI price = $1

alise create a pool of DAI/WETH pool by putting 10 WETH, 30000 DAI token, in total heaving value $60,000(To make it simple, we will not take the transaction fees into consideration)
now Alise become liquidity provider
now suppose WETH price goes upto $4,687.this will create a huge arbitrage opportunity, so immediately, an arbitrageur will buy ETH in Aliceâ€™s pool until the price is at par with the outside market.

so, after some arbitrage, alise pool will look like below (we are not considering tx fee)

DAI = 37,500, ETH =8
total amout of usd = $75,000((8ETH * $4,687.5) + 37,500))
if she had hold these token externally
value would be = 10*4.687.5+ 30000;
               =  $76,875
impermanent loos = 76875 -75000 =1,875
